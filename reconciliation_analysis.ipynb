Some difference is expected since the datasets measure slightly different things — we're just flagging larger differences so you can take a closer look.\n\n### Column guide\n\n| Column | What it means |\n|--------|---------------|\n| `headcount_change` | How much the employee count changed (ending − starting) |\n| `hires_minus_departures` | What the change would be based on hiring/leaving records |\n| `headcount_says` | Growing or shrinking according to headcount? |\n| `activity_says` | Growing or shrinking according to hires/departures? |\n| `opposite_stories` | TRUE when headcount and activity point in opposite directions |"
